  kokelnet-mailgraph - log parser to create mail and imap statistics
  by Tobias Hachmer <network@kokelnet.de>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mailgraph is a very simple mail and imap statistics RRDtool frontend 
that produces daily, weekly, monthly and yearly graphs of:

Mail:
  - received/ sent E-Mails
  - rejects (also postscreen is supported)
  - bounces
  - spam
  - viruses
  - received/ sent via IPv4/ IPv6
  - active-/ incoming-/ maildrop-queue (postfix)
  - deferred mails (postfix)
  - delivered (lmtp), e.g. for mailbox servers
  - greylisted
  - delayed

IMAP/ POP3:
  - Logins via IMAP (non TLS/ TLS)
  - Logins via POP3 (non TLS/ TLS)
  - failed Logins
  - Logins via IPv4/ IPv6

Actually, only the regular expressions related to postfix and dovecot
are under active development. If you wish to have support for other
MTA- or IMAP-/ POP3-Software feel free to contribute!


Required Modules
----------------

- rrdtool and it's perl module (RRDs)
- File::Tail (which requires Time::HiRes)
- Parse::Syslog
- Data::Validate::IP
- NetAddr::IP

Note that several Linux distributions will already have these modules as RPMs.


Usage
-----

mailgraph is made of the following scripts:

- mailgraph.pl

  This script does parse syslog and updates the RRD databases 
  in the current directory.

  It is a deamon and will monitor your log-file for changes.
  DO NOT RUN IT WITH CRON!

  usage: mailgraph.pl [*options*]

  -h, --help         display this help and exit
  -v, --verbose      be verbose about what you do
  -V, --version      output version information and exit
  -c, --cat          causes the logfile to be only read and not monitored
  -l, --logfile f    monitor logfile f instead of /var/log/syslog
  -t, --logtype t    set logfile's type (default: syslog)
  -y, --year         starting year of the log file (default: current year)
      --host=HOST    use only entries for HOST (regexp) in syslog
  -d, --daemon       start in the background
  --daemon-pid=FILE  write PID to FILE instead of /var/run/mailgraph.pid
  --daemon-rrd=DIR   write RRDs to DIR instead of /var/log
  --daemon-log=FILE  write verbose-log to FILE instead of /var/log/mailgraph.log
  --ignore-localhost ignore mail to/from localhost (used for virus scanner)
  --ignore-host=HOST ignore mail to/from HOST regexp (used for virus scanner)
  --no-mail-rrd      don't update the mail rrd
  --no-virus-rrd     don't update the virus rrd
  --no-greylist-rrd  don't update the greylist rrd
  --no-queue-rrd     don't update the queue rrd
  --no-imap-rrd      don't update the imap rrd
  --rrd-name=NAME    use NAME.rrd, NAME_virus.rrd and so on for the rrd files
  --rbl-is-spam      count rbl rejects as spam
  --virbl-is-virus   count virbl rejects as viruses
  
  If -c is not specified, mailgraph will monitor logfile for log entries
  in logfile (/var/log/syslog unless -l is specified).

  By default mailgraph.pl counts one E-Mail as received and sent. This is related
  to the different stages of a mail flow in postfix design. It depends on what
  philosophy you prefer. From my point of view I want that mailgraph.pl running
  on a mail relay only counts one E-Mail the server receives inbound once. The 
  same for E-Mails the server receives for outbound.

  To accomplish that there is one array where you can define your IPv4-/ IPv6 
  hosts and subnets mailgraph.pl will ignore for counting while receiving from
  or sending to them. For an example see the comment above the array declaration
  in mailgraph.pl.

  If running mailgraph.pl on mailbox servers you probably want only count that
  messages which postfix has delivered, e.g. via lmtp or dovecot-deliver to 
  dovecot. At the moment only mails delivered via lmtp are count as delivered.

- mailgraph.cgi

  This is a CGI script that does generate graphics from the RRD database.

  You have probably to change $rrd to point to where the RRD database is stored.

  Note that "Bounced", "Viruses", and "Spam" are stacked one on another in the
  graph, whereas "Rejected" is a line.

- mailgraph-imap.cgi

  This is a CGI script that does generate the imap related graphics from the RRD database.

  You have probably to change $rrd_imap to point to where the RRD database is stored.

- mailqueue.sh

  This is a simple bash script which logs the actual values for the postfix active-/
  incoming- and maildrop queues as well as the amount of the actual deferred mails to 
  syslog. Example:

  May  4 15:34:01 relay mailqueue: active: 11, deferred: 5

  This is necessary in order mailgraph.pl is able to recognize it.

- create_mailgraph_pics.pl

  This script generates just the pictures of your graphs. This is for people who don't
  want to access the statistics every time via http://<url>/cgi-bin/mailgraph.cgi !
  Run this script via cron e.g. every 5 minutes and you are able to integrate the
  statistic graphs on every website you want by copying them e.g. via scp to the
  web server you want. It is up to you where you create the pictures. E.g it is also
  possible to copy the rrd databases to another server and create the pictures there.


Installation
------------

See the file mailgraph-init for an example init script that you can use to
start mailgraph at system boot.

You need to put mailgraph.cgi and probably mailgraph-imap.cgi on somewhere accessible though a web-server, it
needs to be executeable and the web-server needs to execute it as a CGI.

In order to count the mailqueue related values run mailqueue.sh every minute via cron.

Example for Installation paths:

/etc/init.d/mailgraph (rename mailgraph-init to mailgraph)
/usr/local/bin/mailgraph.pl
/usr/local/bin/create_mailgraph_pics.pl
/usr/local/bin/mailqueue.sh
/var/lib/mailgraph/ (path where rrd databases are stored if you are running mailgraph as a daemon and set rrd path)
/var/run/mailgraph.pid
